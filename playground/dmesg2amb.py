# Howdy!  This is a quick and dirty tool to convert AMBE2+ frames from
# the dmesg log of my MD380 into the .amb file format expected by DSD,
# so that it can be converted to audio.  Later on, we can move this
# conversion into the radio, so that audio can be extracted over USB
# without involving ugly host-side Python scripts.

# You must define AMBEPRINT in config.h.  The output is very scratchy,
# but you can make out the audio over the noise.

# AMBECORRECTEDPRINT taps the same bits from a different function
# call.  You probably shouldn't use it.

# Thanks to David and Jonathan.
