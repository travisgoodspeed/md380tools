# Howdy!

# This is a quick and dirty tool to dump WAV files from an MD380 over
# USB.  The firmware must be patched with AMBEWAVPRINT enabled in
# config.h, and the USB patch must be fast enough to catch the frames
# without corruption, while still leaving enough time for the C5000
# process to run.

# If you have things configured correctly, the resulting output.wav
# file ought to sound rather good.
