//  Helper for the 'application menu' (app_menu.c) to set
//  the current DMR talkgroup directly (without Tytera menu),
//  and KEEP IT SET even when returning from the application menu
//  to the 'idle screen' by setting channel_num = 0 
//  (which redraw the idle screen even when on a busy FM channel,
//   but also reloads struct contact (which contains the TG) 
//   from the codeplug / SPI-Flash or whatever .
// Details in amenu_set_tg.c .

extern int     ad_hoc_talkgroup;  // "wanted" talkgroup, set by user / alternative menu

                                  // 0 : "don't want to modify the TG on ANY channel" .
extern uint8_t channel_num; // this variable belongs to THE ORIGINAL FIRMWARE (for us, READ-ONLY)
