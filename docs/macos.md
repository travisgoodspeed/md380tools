## Preparing build environment ##

#### With Homebrew: ####

    brew update
    brew upgrade
    brew install binutils libusb
    brew cask install gcc-arm-embedded # This is where you get the ARM cross-compiling stuff
    sudo pip2 install pyusb

#### Fix the environment statements: ####

The scripts look for python2, but you likely just have that installed as (system) python. Hence:

    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/python2

After this, `make flash` as expected.
