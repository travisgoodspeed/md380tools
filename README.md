A few of us are also on the #md380 IRC channel on Freenode.

# Introduction #

This repository contains tools for working with codeplugs and firmware
of the Tytera MD380, which is also sold under a variety of different
brand names.  The codeplug format is sufficiently similar to the
radios from Connect Systems (CS700, etc) that these tools might
someday be made compatible.

Client Tools:
* `md380-dfu` reads and writes MD380 codeplugs and firmware.
* `md380-tool` communicates with the patched firmware. (Fancy stuff!)

Development Tools:
* `stm32-dfu` modifies firmware for jailbroken devices. (No longer required.)
* `md380-fw` wraps and unwraps devices firmware.
* `md380-gfx` modifies firmware graphics.

## Build Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/travisgoodspeed/md380tools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/travisgoodspeed/md380tools)


## Supported Hardware ##

The patched firmware is known to work on the following devices:

* The "D"-Version (NoGPS) for radios **without GPS**
  * Tytera/TYT MD380
  * Tytera/TYT MD390
  * Retevis RT3

* The "S"-Version (GPS) for radios **with GPS**
  * Tytera/TYT MD380
  * Tytera/TYT MD390
  * Retevis RT8

Both types of vocoder (old and new vocoder radios) are supported.

The DMR MARC user's database required a 16 MByte SPI Flash memory chip.
In some VHF Radios is only an 1 MByte SPI Flash installed.

## Known models ##

| Name | vocoder | GPS | exp FW | original FW |
|---------|-----|---|---------|---------|
| MD-380  | old | N | D02,D13 | D02,D03 |
| MD-380  | new | N | D02,D13 | D02,D13 |
| MD-380G | new | Y | D02,S13 | S13     |
| MD-390  | new | N | D02,D13 | D13     |
| MD-390G | new | Y | D02,S13 | S13     |

  * RT3 = MD-380 (old)
  * RT8 = MD-390G

### The md380tools have D13.020 as basic now. ###

<strike>
to build the "old" d02.32 version

	make flash_D02

These tools are all wrapped into `Makefile`, which will download the
official firmware, patch and flash it.  Run `make flash` after booting
into the recovery bootloader by holding PTT and the button just above
it during power-on.  Once device has been powered on, run `make flashdb`
to write the DMR MARC user's database to SPI Flash memory. This works only
with Radios that have 16 MByte SPI Flash memory chip installed.

## License: ##

The majority of this software is licensed in exchange for two liters
of India Pale Ale, to be delivered at a neighborly bar, preferably one
without a god-damned squary-stary-box.

The DFU tools are GPL licensed, forked from old examples in the
Ubertooth Project.  If you want md380-dfu or stm32-dfu under different
terms, you should probably discuss it with the Great Scott Gadgets
folks over some beer.

Tytera's firmware is of unknown license and is not included in this
repository.  We use a heap-less printf library under the BSD license.


## Specifications: ##

* The MD380 uses a custom variant of DFU that isn't quite compatible
  with the spec.  Their code seems to be forked from an STMicro
  example for the STM32 chip.

* Universal Serial Bus Device Class Specification for Device
  Firmware Upgrade, version 1.1:
  http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/devclass_docs/DFU_1.1.pdf
  


## Requirements: ##

* Python 2.7 or newer:
  http://www.python.org

* PyUSB 1.0:  (0.4 does not work.)
  http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/pyusb/

* libusb 1.0: (0.4 does not work.)
  http://www.libusb.org/

This project should work across Linux, Mac OS, and Windows, but has
not been tested on all platforms.  A separate client, MD380Tool,
is under development for Android.

### Preparation of build environment ###

* [Debian](docs/debian.md)
* [Ubuntu](docs/ubuntu.md)
* [Fedora](docs/fedora.md)
* [SUSE](docs/suse.md)
* [Raspberry Pi](docs/raspi.md)
* [Windows](docs/windows.md)
* [MacOS](docs/macos.md)

### Additional steps for linux based installations ###

```
git clone https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/md380tools.git
cd md380tools
sudo cp 99-md380.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/ 
```
(The 99-md380.rules file is copied to /etc/udev/rules.d/ in order to allow users to access the radio over USB without having to use sudo or root permissions.)

### Flash updated firmware for linux based installations ###

Turn on radio in DFU mode to begin firmware update with USB cable:
* insert cable into USB.
* connect cable to MD380.
* power-on MD380 by turning volume knob, while holding PTT button and button above PTT.

For non-GPS-models do:
```
git pull
make flash
```
For GPS-models do:
```
git pull
make flash_S13
```

### Flash updated users database for linux based installations ###

Turn radio normally on to begin database loading with USB cable

For European users:
```
make updatedb_eur flashdb
```
Note: for European users it is probably illegal to use the other method for updating, due to privacy laws.
(This is no legal advice, please consult your lawyer to be sure.)

For the rest of the world:
```
make updatedb flashdb
```

(The `users.csv` file located in the db directory must be refreshed this way, 
with `make updatedb`, otherwise it will continue using any already-existing 
`users.csv` file when running `make flashdb`.)

## Convenient Usage: ##

Anything with `md380-tool` requires a recent version of our patched
firmware.  You can check your version in Menu/Utilities/Radio
Info/Version.  If it's a recent date you're good; if it's a number,
you need to upgrade.


To dump the recent dmesg log:

    md380-tool dmesg

## Firmware Compilation ##

This archive does not ship with firmware.  Instead it grabs firmware
from the Internet, decrypts it, and applies patches to that revision.

You can reproduce the patched firmware with `make clean dist` after
installing an arm-none-eabi cross compiler toolchain.  The firmware
and a Windows flashing tool will then appear in
`md380tools-yyyy-mm-dd`.  Alternately, you can flash them from Linux
with `make clean flash`, after starting the recovery bootloader by
holding PTT and the button above it during a radio reboot.

## Windows Firmware Installation ##

You can install any of these patched firmware files into your MD380 by
using the respective .bin file with the Tytera Windows firmware
upgrade tool, `upgrade.exe`, available inside their firmware upgrade
downloads. Here are the steps:

* Turn off your MD380 using the volume knob.
* Attach the Tytera USB cable to the SP and MIC ports of your MD380.
* Attach the Tytera USB cable to your host computer.
* Hold down the PTT and the button above the PTT button (*not* the button with the "M" on it).
* Turn on your MD380 using the volume knob.
* Release the buttons on the radio.
* The status LED should be on and alternating between red and green, indicating you're in flash upgrade mode.
* Start the Tytera `Upgrade.exe` program.
* Click "Open Update File" and choose one of the .bin files produced from the process above.
* Click "Download Update File" and wait for the flash update process to finish. It takes less than a minute.
* Turn off your MD380 using the volume knob.
* Disconnect the USB cable from your MD380 and host computer.
* Turn the MD380 back on, and you should see the "PoC||GTFO" welcome screen. You're running patched firmware!

## Chirp Driver: ##

Also included is a partial driver for the MD380 in Chirp.  This driver
doesn't yet support the essential DMR features, but it does handle
analog channels and banks well enough to load analog repeaters into
your radio.

This driver can't yet communicate with the radio, so use `md380-dfu
read foo.img` to read an image out of the radio, then open it in Chirp
after installing `chirp/md380.py` as a driver.  Once you've made your
changes, you can load the image back in by running `md380-dfu write
foo.img`.

## Customization ##

Temponary not avaible, see https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/md380tools/issues/221


<strike>
Images extracted from the firmware have comments at the beginning of
the file, telling md380-gfx where they came from. Comments begin with a '#', and end with a new line.

Image editors like GIMP will discard the original comments, but you can
replace them by opening the file in a text editor and copy-pasting the
comment lines from the original extracted file to your custom image.


#### Boot logo ####

There are several boot logos provided that you can choose from by editing
`patches/2.032/Makefile`, and commenting/uncommenting as you see fit.

The original boot logo is 160x40 pixels, and only 2 colors.  This means
an image that has the same properties can be written into the firmware
as a direct replacement, as seen in the Makefile.

An image with more than two colors requires the "relocate" argument to
md380-gfx. There are examples of this in the Makefile as well.
