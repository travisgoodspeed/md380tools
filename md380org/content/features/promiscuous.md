DMR repeaters these days carry a number of talkgroups, but those
talkgroups are always changing and it can be a pain to constantly
update to the latest codeplugs, or to merge codeplugs from multiple
repeaters in your region.

MD380Tools comes to the rescue with Promiscuous Mode.  Enabling this
optional feature will cause your radio to play audio whenever *any*
traffic comes in on your selected timeslot.  You can then quickly jot
down the settings to update your codeplug.
