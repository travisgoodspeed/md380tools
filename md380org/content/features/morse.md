DMR opens up a whole new world of digital ham radio, but it can be a
bit awkward to use for hams who are unable to see the screen.

MD380Tools solves this with a narration feature that can be enabled
through the MD380Tools menu.  This narrator will beep station names
and other on-screen items audibly in Morse code so you can know which
Zone or Channel is selected without looking at the screen.
