Your radio knows a lot of information about the network that you don't
need to see every day, but when something goes wrong you'd like to see
it.  Our Network Monitor features allow you to packet headers, RX and
transmit frequencies, color codes, and timeslots at the push of a
button.

Press 8 or 9 at the desktop to see information on the incoming signal,
while pressing 7 will bring you back to the default screen.
