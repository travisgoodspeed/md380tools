When DMR was first becoming popular, a codeplug circulated with some
seven hundred of the most popular American users.  Very quickly, that
became unmaintainable, so MD380Tools allows you to flash a database of
sixty thousand international users.  When an incoming call arrives,
you'll see the user's name, callsign and country.

Because this database is separate from your contacts, you can keep
your contact list nice and small, listing only those folks you intend
to directly call or text message.
