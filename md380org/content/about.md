MD380Tools is a patched firmware distribution for the Tytera MD380.
It adds support for a number of features including promiscuous mode, a
CallerID database, USB logging, and Morse code narration.

Source code for our firmware patches is available at
[travisgoodspeed/md380tools](http://github.com/travisgoodspeed/md380tools/)
on Github in C, which is patched into what we've reverse engineered of
the official firmware.
