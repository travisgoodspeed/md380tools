Linux users can build and install MD380Tools from our source code at
[travisgoodspeed/md380tools](http://github.com/travisgoodspeed/md380tools/)
on Github.  This technique works from inside of a virtual machine, and
some folks have been able to get it working on Windows as well.

For those who would rather install prebuilt firmware, we offer [daily
builds](http://md380.org/releases/daily/) which are updated whenever
our master branch has changed.  These include the manufacturer's
Windows installer.
