Howdy y'all,

This is a quick little work-in-progress website to make MD380Tools,
the patched firmware for the Tytera MD380, a bit easier to install and
use.

Development of the firmware will proceed as it always has at
[travisgoodspeed/md380tools](http://github.com/travisgoodspeed/md380tools/)
on Github.
